A project idea that I had to make rich presence for Media Player similar to spotify. 

Current main issues that may or may not get fixed:
1. Timer is not dynamic so it resets based on the sleep duration.
2. Sometimes does not accurately display the title/author.
3. Does not have a time bar in discord.
4. Does not store previous tracks. Which needs to happen because it'll lessen the load of script.
